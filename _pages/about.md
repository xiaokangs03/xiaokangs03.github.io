Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Xiaokang Sun, currently a senior undergraduate at Tsinghua University, majoring in Automation. I have a deep passion for robotics, machine learning and control theory and have been actively involved in various related research projects and lab work during my undergraduate studies. 

I've had the opportunity to collaborate with sevral professors in the field. I am working at University of California, Riverside with [Prof. Jiachen Li](https://jiachenli94.github.io/), focusing on safe and data-efficient long-horizon robot manipulation. I also conduct reseach at Tsinghua University under the guidance of [Prof. Jianyu Chen](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/), where I contribute to task planning for manipulation with large language model. Additionally, I work at Tsinghua University with [Prof. Yao Jiang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086023995), focusing on tactile-based skill learning.

Specific research interest & future phd applicant plan...
